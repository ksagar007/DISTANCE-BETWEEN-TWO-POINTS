# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import math
### Step 2: And get a two values from the user as input
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: Print the statement with .format
### Step 5: End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
